# Session5: PyTorch

* The session introduces about the pros and cons and competitors and way of implementation of pytorch. ðŸ¥³

# Assignment: 

* Here we go, the assignment deals with modular programming where the runs & codes of notebook has to re-written to files such that we can just import it.
* Writing the code is important but re-writing the code that can be understood clearly by the different person is very very important. We term this work as 'Modular Programming'. 

* Go through this blog for understanding modular programming: https://towardsdatascience.com/mastering-modular-programming-how-to-take-your-python-skills-to-the-next-level-ba14339e8429

* The repository has a Jupyter notebook where we do import all the modules from the files like main.py, utils.py.
                        
              * model.py: The file which contains the designed neural network.
              * utils.py: The file that contains the code utilites (or useful scripts) to the main program.
              
* The assignment demands to move the respective code to respective file.
