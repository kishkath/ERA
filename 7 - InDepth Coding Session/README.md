# MNIST-V1

Session7: Session-7 deepens the level of designing the neural network step-by-step

Steps briefly followed as:

1. Skeleton
2. Less-Weighted-Model.
3. Batch-Normalization
4. Augmentation
5. Dropout
6. Playing with LR's.

* The Assignment asks to design these practices to achieve the accuracy of 99.4 within 15 Epochs such that model maintaining parameters less than 8000.

* The 3 practices have been done,

    model1.py: Just a model to make it learn regardless of its computation.
    model2.py: A model designed as a skeleton design for the next steps.
    model3.py: The precise network designed with less than 8000 parameters.
